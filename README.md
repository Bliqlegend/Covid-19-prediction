 Aim:   Covid -19 prediction model using Data Science and Python

Objective:

•	Prediction of number of Covid-19 cases in the future
•	Data analysis and modelling using data science
•	Using SIR model which stands for Susceptible,Infectious,Recovered 

Idea:

•	Fetching the previous data in the csv format from  github where data gets updated daily from government api 
•	Using Pandas to read csv files containing the data
•	Figure how this spread has progressed over a period of time, We plotted the confirmed cases 
•	 Looked at the progression of recovered, death and active cases as well. 
•	Looking at how this virus has spread across India so far by plotting the four India specific time-series and annotating those with the events manually. 
•	Now modelling and predicting Covid-19 cases using SIR 

 
Motivation:

•	SIR model has proven to be very effective for other diseases like measles, mumps, rubella, and pertussis. 
•	Companies and Government should have an idea of how will be the situation in future
